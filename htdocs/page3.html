                    Healthcare workers such as nurses are paid less than how much they should be paid. Especially during these times when they are needed to work overtime in hospitals. Not only do they work overtime, but they are also exposed to the COVID-19 virus and are at risk of getting infected. Since many doctors and other healthcare workers chose to work in private hospitals and facilities because of the small salaries offered by the public sector, public hospitals became understaffed, which led to their staff working overtime.

                    Aside from low pay, the workersâ€™ benefits are also delayed. Other health workers do not receive the special risk allowance that the government has promised to them. Health workers are among the first to be given the COVID-19 vaccines, which is essential to them since they are often exposed to the virus.
