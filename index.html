                    The healthcare system in the Philippines is seen as “fragmented” by the World Health Association. With the rise of the pandemic last year (2020), the country has been facing more and more problems. A lot of opinions say that “the Philippine Healthcare System was never ready for a pandemic. A strong and unified healthcare system is needed to protect and save the lives of millions of people in our country. Having a strong healthcare system would still be hard to achieve because of the finances it will cost and other current problems the country is facing, but healthcare must still be prioritized. Health is one of the most important matters in our lives and the need for providing access to affordable healthcare facilities and materials/equipment must be one of the top priorities of a country. The following pages below show the different problems the healthcare system in the Philippines and how they are being addressed.
